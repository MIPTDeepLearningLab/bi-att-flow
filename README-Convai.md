# Requirements

- Python 3

# How to run

1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. `python run_demo.py`
3. `python get_answer.py --question "What branch of theoretical computer science deals with broadly classifying computational problems by difficulty and class of relationship?" --paragraph "Computational complexity theory is a branch of the theory of computation in theoretical computer science that focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty, and relating those classes to each other. A computational problem is understood to be a task that is in principle amenable to being solved by a computer, which is equivalent to stating that the problem may be solved by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm."`

Output: `Computational complexity theory`
